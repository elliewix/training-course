I am a current master’s student in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science ([GSLIS](https://www.lis.illinois.edu/)) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in data curation and analytics.  I am also the co-organizer of Champaign Urbana’s Python User Group ([PyCU](http://py-cu.github.io/)) where I’ve led several Python workshops.  I am particularly interested in teaching programming and software skills to graduate students and researchers from non-STEM backgrounds, especially the social sciences and humanities.  I am completing this training as part of an independent study where I am evaluating technology education for library science students and participating as a TA for the current Python programming class within that program.  

What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...

Everything?  Not only am I completely failing to pick up the complex workflows, there is also unclear community etiquette.  So I'm not only really unsure about what I'm doing, but I'm also afraid that I'm going to do the incorrect thing in a public forum.  I'm used to simple workflows in CVS where you update, check the diffs, resolve as needed, and commit.
